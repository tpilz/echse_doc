  journal = {Environmental Modelling \& Software},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {895-910},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {Of concern to the environmental modelling community is the proliferation
	of individual, and individualistic, models and the time associated
	with common model development tasks such as data transformation,
	coding of models, and visualisation. One way of addressing this problem
	is the adoption of modelling frameworks. These frameworks, or environments,
	support modular model development through provision of libraries
	of core environmental modelling modules, as well as reusable tools
	for data manipulation, analysis and visualisation. Such frameworks
	have a range of features and requirements related to the architecture,
	protocols and methods of operation, and it is difficult to compare
	the modelling workload and performance of alternative frameworks
	without using them to undertake identical, or similar modelling tasks.
	This paper describes the outcomes of a workshop to compare three
	frameworks â the Spatial Modelling Environment (SME), Tarsier and
	the Integrated Component Modelling System (ICMS). A simple environmental
	problem linking hillslope flow and soil erosion processes with a
	receiving water store was designed and then implemented in the three
	frameworks. It was found that the \{SME\} and Tarsier contained many
	components well suited to handling complex spatial and temporal models,
	with \{ICMS\} being an integrated framework tailored for smaller
	scale problems. Of the three tested frameworks, the \{SME\} proved
	superior in supporting problem description, Tarsier provided more
	flexibility in linking and validating the model components, and \{ICMS\}
	served as an effective prototyping tool. The test problem, and associated
	data and parameters, are described in detail to allow others to undertake
	this test. },

  journal = {Environmental Modelling \& Software},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {62},
  pages = {70 - 84},
  abstract = {Abstract Distributed, physics-based hydrologic models require spatially
	explicit specification of parameters related to climate, geology,
	land-cover, soil, and topography. Extracting these parameters from
	national geodatabases requires intensive data processing. Furthermore,
	mapping these parameters to model mesh elements necessitates development
	of data access tools that can handle both spatial and temporal datasets.
	This paper presents an open-source, platform independent, tightly
	coupled \{GIS\} and distributed hydrologic modeling framework, \{PIHMgis\}
	(www.pihm.psu.edu), to improve model-data integration. Tight coupling
	is achieved through the development of an integrated user interface
	with an underlying shared geodata model, which improves data flow
	between the \{PIHMgis\} data processing components. The capability
	and effectiveness of the \{PIHMgis\} framework in providing functionalities
	for watershed delineation, domain decomposition, parameter assignment,
	simulation, visualization and analyses, is demonstrated through prototyping
	of a model simulation. The framework and the approach are applicable
	for watersheds of varied sizes, and offer a template for future GIS-Model
	integration efforts. },

  year = {2014},
  volume = {61},
  pages = {249-265},
  abstract = {Abstract One of the most of challenging steps in the development of
	coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models is the combination of
	multiple, often incompatible computer codes that describe individual
	physical, chemical, biological and geological processes. This “coupling”
	is time-consuming, error-prone, and demanding in terms of scientific
	and programming expertise. The open source, Fortran-based Framework
	for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing
	a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic
	and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect
	to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical
	models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified
	within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column,
	and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry
	can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled
	at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled
	coupling of biogeochemical models, \{FABM\} enables optimal use of
	the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users. },

  abstract = {The environmental modeling community has historically been concerned
	with the proliferation of models and the effort associated with collective
	model development tasks (e.g., code generation, data transformation,
	etc.). Environmental modeling frameworks (EMFs) have been developed
	to address this problem, but much work remains before \{EMFs\} are
	adopted as mainstream modeling tools. Environmental model development
	requires both scientific understanding of environmental phenomena
	and software developer proficiency. \{EMFs\} support the modeling
	process through streamlining model code development, allowing seamless
	access to data, and supporting data analysis and visualization. \{EMFs\}
	also support aggregation of model components into functional units,
	component interaction and communication, temporal-spatial stepping,
	scaling of spatial data, multi-threading/multi-processor support,
	and cross-language interoperability. Some \{EMFs\} additionally focus
	on high-performance computing and are tailored for particular modeling
	domains such as ecosystem, socio-economic, or climate change research.
	The Object Modeling System Version 3 (OMS3) \{EMF\} employs new advances
	in software framework design to better support the environmental
	model development process. This paper discusses key \{EMF\} design
	goals/constraints and addresses software engineering aspects that
	have made \{OMS3\} framework development efficacious and its application
	practical, as demonstrated by leveraging software engineering efforts
	outside of the modeling community and lessons learned from over a
	decade of \{EMF\} development. Software engineering approaches employed
	in \{OMS3\} are highlighted including a non-invasive lightweight
	framework design supporting component-based model development, use
	of implicit parallelism in system design, use of domain specific
	language design patterns, and cloud-based support for computational
	scalability. The key advancements in \{EMF\} design presented herein
	may be applicable and beneficial for other \{EMF\} developers seeking
	to better support environmental model development through improved
	framework design.},

	is presented, which combines forecasts from the European COSMO-LEPS,
	SRNWP-PEPS and COSMO-DE prediction systems. A multi-model lagged
	average super-ensemble is generated by recombining members from different
	runs of these meteorological forecast systems. A subset of the super-ensemble
	is selected based on a priori model weights, which are obtained from
	ensemble calibration. Flood forecasts are simulated by the conceptual
	rainfall-runoff-model ArcEGMO. Parameter uncertainty of the model
	is represented by a parameter ensemble, which is a priori generated
	from a comprehensive uncertainty analysis during model calibration.
	The use of a computationally efficient hydrological model within
	a flood management system allows us to compute the hydro-meteorological
	model chain for all members of the sub-ensemble. The model chain
	is not re-computed before new ensemble forecasts are available, but
	the probabilistic assessment of the output is updated when new information
	from deterministic short range forecasts or from assimilation of
	measured data becomes available. For hydraulic modelling, with the
	desired result of a probabilistic inundation map with high spatial
	resolution, a replacement model can help to overcome computational
	limitations. A prototype of the developed framework has been applied
	for a case study in the Mulde river basin. However these techniques,
	in particular the probabilistic assessment and the derivation of
	decision rules are still in their infancy. Further research is necessary

	for hydrological forecasting and modelling of water resources at
	the basin scale. It has been designed and implemented to emphasize
	the comparison of modelling solutions and reproduce hydrological
	modelling results in a straightforward manner. It is composed of
	two parts: (i) the data and result visualization system, based on
	the Geographic Information System uDig and (ii) the component-based
	modelling system, built on top of the Object Modelling System v3.
	Modelling components can be selected, adapted, and connected according
	to the needs of the modeller and then executed within the uDig spatial
	toolbox. Hence, the system provides an ideal and modern integration
	of models and \{GIS\} without invalidating existing solutions. Compared
	to traditional hydrological models, which are built upon monolithic
	code, JGrass-NewAge allows for multiple modelling solutions for the
	same physical process, provided they share similar input and output
	constraints. Modelling components are connected by means of a concise
	scripting language. Furthermore, the system utilizes the Pfafstetter
	numbering scheme to represent the digital watershed model; the adaption
	of this topological classification of a basin with respect to NewAge
	is explained in this paper. Finally, the system application for the
	Fort Cobb watershed and its results are presented. },

  journal = {Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.},

  pages = {145-164},
  abstract = {Rainfall data of high temporal resolution are required in a multitude
	of hydrological applications. In the present paper, a temporal rainfall
	disaggregation model is applied to convert daily time series into
	an hourly resolution. The model is based on the principles of random
	multiplicative cascade processes. Its parameters are dependent on
	(1) the volume and (2) the position in the rainfall sequence of the
	time interval with rainfall to be disaggregated. The aim is to compare
	parameters and performance of the model between two contrasting climates
	with different rainfall generating mechanisms, a semi-arid tropical
	(Brazil) and a temperate (United Kingdom) climate. In the range of
	time scales studied, the scale-invariant assumptions of the model
	are approximately equally well fulfilled for both climates. The model
	parameters differ distinctly between climates, reflecting the dominance
	of convective processes in the Brazilian rainfall and of advective
	processes associated with frontal passages in the British rainfall.
	In the British case, the parameters exhibit a slight seasonal variation
	consistent with the higher frequency of convection during summer.
	When applied for disaggregation, the model reproduces a range of
	hourly rainfall characteristics with a high accuracy in both climates.
	However, the overall model performance is somewhat better for the
	semi-arid tropical rainfall. In particular, extreme rainfall in the
	UK is overestimated whereas extreme rainfall in Brazil is well reproduced.
	Transferability of parameters in time is associated with larger uncertainty
	in the semi-arid climate due to its higher interannual variability
	and lower percentage of rainy intervals. For parameter transferability
	in space, no restrictions are found between the Brazilian stations
	whereas in the UK regional differences are more pronounced. The overall
	high accuracy of disaggregated data supports the potential usefulness
	of the model in hydrological applications.},

	up to six hours ahead. There are three main components, producing
	analyses and forecasts of precipitation, cloud and visibility, respectively.
	The precipitation rate analysis uses processed radar and satellite
	data, together with surface reports and NWP fields. The forecast
	is based on an object advection technique, modified for growth and
	decay using model products. Related variables, such as precipitation
	type, are also diagnosed using the NWP fields. The cloud analysis
	is based largely on satellite imagery and surface reports, the forecast
	being carried out in a similar way to precipitation rate. The visibility
	analysis combines surface reports with NWP model fields and satellite
	imagery: Meteosat during the day and NOAAâAVHRR at night. The forecast
	is an extrapolation using trends from the NWP model, and relaxing
	towards the model values themselves. Results show a substantial improvement
	over both persistence and raw NWP model products. Copyright Â© 1998

  journal = {Computers \& Geosciences},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {33},
  pages = {1301-1315},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK),
	its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple
	example and three casestudies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique
	that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary
	variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery
	and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals.
	It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously
	called “Universal Kriging” (UK) and “Kriging with External Drift”
	(KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the
	kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the
	method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate
	interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing
	and interpretation of results are illustrated with three casestudies
	covering the national territory of Croatia. The casestudies use land
	surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography
	Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced
	vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors.
	These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil
	organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature)
	and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping
	temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature
	at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model
	with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues:
	implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of
	RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations
	to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that
	the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments,
	both statistical and GIS.},

  journal = {Weather and Forecasting},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {559-570},
  abstract = {Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was
	proposed as a new verification tool for (probabilistic) forecast
	systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain
	(weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability
	score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively,
	it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all
	possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration.
	For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean
	absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction
	system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty
	part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier
	score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the
	rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/ uncertainty
	part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and
	the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition
	is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the
	European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation
	of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended
	to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing
	that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts
	with an infinite number of members.},

  abstract = {Routine availability of hydrological, geological, and other physiographic
	data today allows us to obtain a priori estimates of hydrologic model
	parameters prior to expli- cit model calibration. When informative
	a priori estimates of model parameters are avail- able, the problem
	of hydrologic model calibration becomes one of filtering, i.e. improving
	the a priori estimates based on observations of input and output
	to and from the hydro- logic system, respectively, rather than one
	of bounded global optimization based solely on the input and output
	data as in traditional model calibration. Given that global optimi-
	zation is computationally very expensive and does not, in general,
	transfer the spatial pat- terns of soil and land surface characteristics
	to the model parameters, the filtering approach is particularly appealing
	for automatic calibration of distributed hydrologic models. Toward
	that ultimate goal, we explore in this work calibration of a lumped
	hydro- logic model via limited optimization of a priori estimates
	of the model parameters. The technique developed for the purpose
	is a simple yet effective and efficient pattern search algorithm
	called the Stepwise Line Search (SLS). To evaluate the methodology,
	calibration and validation experiments were performed for 20 basins
	in the US National Weather Ser- vice West Gulf River Forecast Center’s
	(NWS/WGRFC) service area in Texas. We show that SLS locates the posterior
	parameter estimates very efficiently in the vicinity of the a priori
	estimates that are comparable, in terms of reducing the objective
	function value, to those from global minimization. A cross validation
	experiment indicates that, when parametric uncertainty due to lack
	of calibration data is considered, limited optimization of a priori
	parameters using SLS may be preferred to global optimization.},

  journal = {Journal of Hydrology},

  volume = {426-427},
  pages = {28-38},
  abstract = {PDF liegt vor. Spatial rainfall is a key input to distributed hydrological
	models, and its precisions heavily affect the accu- racy of stream
	flow predictions from a hydrological model. Traditional interpolation
	techniques which obtain the spatial rainfall distribution from rain
	gauge data have some limitations caused by data scarcity and bad
	quality, especially in developing countries or remote locations.
	Satellite-based precipitation products are expected to offer an alternative
	to ground-based rainfall estimates in the present and the foreseeable
	future. For this purpose, the quality and usefulness of satellite-based
	precipitation products need to be evaluated. The present study compares
	the difference of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall
	with rain gauges data at different time scales and evaluates the
	usefulness of the TRMM rainfall for hydrological processes simulation
	and water balance analysis at the Xinjiang catchment, located in
	the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The results show
	at daily time step TRMM rainfall data are better at determining rain
	occurrence and mean values than at determining the rainfall extremes,
	and larger difference exists for the maximal daily and maximal 5-day
	rainfalls. At monthly time scale, good linear relationships between
	TRMM rainfall and rain gauges rainfall data are received with the
	determination coefficients (R2) varying between 0.81 and 0.89 for
	the individual stations and 0.88 for areal average rainfall data,
	respectively. But the slope of regression line ranges between 0.74
	for Yingtan and 0.94 for Yushan, indicating that the TRMM satellite
	is inclined to underestimate the monthly rainfall in this area. The
	simulation of daily hydrological processes shows that the Water Flow
	Model for Lake Catchment (WATLAC) model using conventional rain gauge
	data produces an overall good fit, but the simulation results using
	TRMM rainfall data are discontented. The evaluation results imply
	that the TRMM rainfall data are unsuited for daily stream flow simulation
	in this study area with desired preci- sions. However, good performance
	can be received using TRMM rainfall data for monthly stream flow
	simulations. The comparison of the simulated annual water balance
	components shows that the different rainfall data sources can change
	the volume value and proportion of water balance components to some
	extent, but it generally meets the need of practical use.},

	the latest Version 7 (V7) and previous Version 6 (V6) of TRMM 3B42
	data were compared and evaluated for a 9-year period covering 2001–2005
	and 2007–2010. The evaluations were conducted at different spatial
	(grid and watershed) and temporal (daily, monthly and annual) scales.
	For evaluation at grid scale, the Thiessen polygon method was used
	to transform pointed-based rain gauge data to areal precipitation
	at the same grid scale (0.25°) as TRMM 3B42 data. The results showed
	that there was little difference in performances of V6 and V7 TRMM
	3B42 products. Overall, both V6 and V7 products slightly overestimated
	precipitation with a bias of 0.04. At daily scale, both V6 and V7
	data were considered to be unreliable with large relative RMSE (135%–199%)
	at the two spatial scales, and they were deficient in capturing large
	storms. These results suggest that local calibration with rain gauge
	data should be conducted before V6 and V7 TRMM 3B42 data are used
	at daily scale. At monthly and annual scales, V6 and V7 TRMM 3B42
	data match the rain gauge data well (R2 = 0.91–0.99, relative RMSE
	= 4%–23%) at both grid and watershed scale and thus have good potential

  abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) holds considerable potential for improving
	hydrologic predictions as demonstrated in numerous research studies.
	However, advances in hydrologic DA research have not been adequately
	or timely implemented in operational forecast systems to improve
	the skill of forecasts for better informed real-world decision making.
	This is due in part to a lack of mechanisms to properly quantify
	the uncertainty in observations and forecast models in real-time
	forecasting situations and to conduct the merging of data and models
	in a way that is adequately efficient and transparent to operational
	forecasters. The need for effective DA of useful hydrologic data
	into the forecast process has become increasingly recognized in recent
	years. This motivated a hydrologic DA workshop in Delft, the Netherlands
	in November 2010, which focused on advancing DA in operational hydrologic
	forecasting and water resources management. As an outcome of the
	workshop, this paper reviews, in relevant detail, the current status
	of DA applications in both hydrologic research and operational practices,
	and discusses the existing or potential hurdles and challenges in
	transitioning hydrologic DA research into cost-effective operational
	forecasting tools, as well as the potential pathways and newly emerging
	opportunities for overcoming these challenges. Several related aspects
	are discussed, including (1) theoretical or mathematical aspects
	in DA algorithms, (2) the estimation of different types of uncertainty,
	(3) new observations and their objective use in hydrologic DA, (4)
	the use of DA for real-time control of water resources systems, and
	(5) the development of community-based, generic DA tools for hydrologic
	applications. It is recommended that cost-effective transition of
	hydrologic DA from research to operations should be helped by developing
	community-based, generic modeling and DA tools or frameworks, and
	through fostering collaborative efforts among hydrologic modellers,
	DA developers, and operational forecasters.},

	with a simple and parsimonious parameterisation. The original TOPKAPI
	is structured around five modules that represent evapotranspiration,
	snowmelt, soil water, surface water and channel water, respectively.
	Percolation to deep soil layers was ignored in the old version of
	the TOPKAPI model since it was not important in the basins to which
	the model was originally applied. Based on published literature,
	this study developed a new version of the TOPKAPI model, in which
	the new modules of interception, infiltration, percolation, groundwater
	flow and lake/reservoir routing are included. This paper presents
	an application study that makes a first attempt to derive information
	from public domains through the internet on the topography, soil
	and land use types for a case study Chinese catchment - the Upper
	Xixian catchment in Huaihe River with an area of about 10000 km2,
	and apply a new version of TOPKAPI to the catchment for flood simulation.
	A model parameter value adjustment was performed using six months
	of the 1998 dataset. Calibration did not use a curve fitting process,
	but was chiefly based upon moderate variations of parameter values
	from those estimated on physical grounds, as is common in traditional
	calibration. The hydrometeorological dataset of 2002 was then used
	to validate the model, both against the outlet discharge as well
	as at an internal gauging station. Finally, to complete the model
	performance analysis, parameter uncertainty and its effects on predictive
	uncertainty were also assessed by estimating a posterior parameter
	probability density via Bayesian inference.},

	increasingly compartmentalized. Here we propose a Database Approach
	To Modelling (DATM) to create unity in dynamical ecosystem modelling
	with differential equations. In this approach the storage of ecological
	knowledge is independent of the language and platform in which the
	model will be run. To create an instance of the model, the information
	in the database is translated and augmented with the language and
	platform specifics. This process is automated so that a new instance
	can be created each time the database is updated. We describe the
	approach using the simple Lotka–Volterra model and the complex ecosystem
	model for shallow lakes PCLake, which we automatically implement
	in the frameworks OSIRIS, \{GRIND\} for MATLAB, ACSL, R, \{DUFLOW\}
	and DELWAQ. A clear advantage of working in a database is the overview
	it provides. The simplicity of the approach only adds to its elegance.

	tically interpolated gauge data, with minimal biases of −0.40 mm
	day−1 , −1.78 mm decad−1 and −6.72 mm month−1 being observed in 2006.
	In the same year, the gauge and TRMM-3B42 rainfall estimates marginally

	increased with increasing temporal intervals for all three consid-
	ered years. Quantitatively, the TRMM-3B42 observations slightly overestimated

	show that the estimates from TRMM-3B42 precipitation retrievals can
	effectively be applied in the inter- polation of missing gauge data,

	scales with minor adjustments, depending on the timescales considered.},

  abstract = {The political pressure on the scientific community to provide medium
	to long term flood forecasts has increased in the light of recent
	flooding events in Europe. Such demands can be met by a system consisting
	of three different model components (weather forecast, rainfall
	runoff forecast and flood inundation forecast) which are all liable
	to considerable uncertainty in the input, output and model parameters.
	Thus, an understanding of cascaded uncertainties is a necessary requirement
	to provide robust predictions. In this paper, 10-day ahead rainfall
	forecasts, consisting of one deterministic, one control and 50 ensemble
	forecasts, are fed into a rainfallrunoff model (LisFlood) for which
	parameter uncertainty is represented by six different parameter sets
	identified through a Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation
	(GLUE) analysis and functional hydrograph classification. The runoff
	of these 52 * 6 realisations form the input to a flood inundation
	model (LisFlood-FP) which acknowledges uncertainty by utilising ten
	different sets of roughness coefficients identified using the same
	GLUE methodology. Likelihood measures for each parameter set computed
	on historical data are used to give uncertain predictions of flow
	hydrographs as well as spatial inundation extent. This analysis demonstrates
	that a full uncertainty analysis of such an integrated system is
	limited mainly by computer power as well as by how well the rainfall
	predictions represent potential future conditions. However, these
	restrictions may be overcome or lessened in the future and this paper
	establishes a computationally feasible methodological approach to
	the uncertainty cascade problem.},

	Reanalyses precipitation from ERA-Interim in southern Australia (SAu)
	and northern Australasia (NAu) showed higher detection performance.
	JRA-25 had a better performance in South and East Asia (SEA) except
	for the monsoon period, in which satellite estimates from TRMM and
	CMORPH outperformed the reanalyses. In terms of accuracy metrics
	(correlation coefficient, root-mean-square difference, and a precipitation
	intensity proxy, which is the ratio of monthly precipitation amount
	to total days with precipitation) and over the three subdomains,
	the depth-frequency-adjusted ensemble mean generally outperformed
	or was nearly as good as any of the single members. The results of
	the ensemble show that additional information is captured from the
	different precipitation products. This finding suggests that, depending
	on precipitation regime and location, combining (re)analysis and
	satellite products can lead to better precipitation estimates and,
	thus, more accurate hydrological applications than selecting any
	single product.},

	In southeast Australia the SOI is a better predictor for JulyâSeptember

	for simulation of water level and discharge. Field measurements of
	river cross-sections are labour intensive and expensive activities.
	Availability of measured river cross-sections is scanty in most of
	the developing countries, thereby making it difficult to simulate
	the water level and discharge using hydraulic models. A methodology
	for extracting river cross-sections from Shuttle Radar Topographic
	Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) of 3-arc second has been
	proposed in the reported study. The extracted river cross-sections
	were used to simulate the magnitude of flood in the deltaic reaches
	of Brahmani river basin located in the eastern India. Forty cross-sections
	along the reaches of the rivers were extracted from the DEM and were
	used in the MIKE 11 hydrodynamic (MIKE 11HD) model. Prior to using
	the DEM-extracted river cross-sections in the model, the cross-sections
	were modified based on the results of the DEM error analysis. Four
	available measured river cross-sections were compared with the DEM-extracted
	modified cross-sections to examine their geometric and hydraulic
	similarity. By changing Manning’s roughness coefficient (n), same
	stage-discharge relationship could be obtained in both types of cross-sections.
	Subsequently, the DEM-extracted cross-sections were used in the MIKE
	11HD model for the simulation of discharge and water levels at various
	sections of the rivers. The model was calibrated for the period of
	June 15–October 31 of the year 1999 and validated for the year 2003.
	The model validation results showed a close agreement between the
	simulated and observed stage hydrographs. The calibrated values of
	Manning’s n were found to vary within the range of 0.02 to 0.033.
	The study revealed that freely available SRTM DEM-extracted river
	cross-sections could be used in hydraulic models to simulate stage
	and discharge hydrographs with considerable accuracy under the scarcity

	shows how a system of mixed equations can be locally reduced to ordinary
	differential equations using the semidiscrete finite volume method
	(FVM). Domain decomposition partitions the watershed surface onto
	an unstructured grid, and vertical projection of each element forms
	a finite volume on which all physical process equations are formed.
	The projected volume or prism is partitioned into surface and subsurface
	layers, leading to a fully coupled, local ODE system, referred to
	as the model ‘‘kernel.’’ The global ODE system is assembled by combining
	the local ODE system over the domain, and is then solved by a state-of-the-art
	ODE solver. The unstructured grid, based on Delaunay triangulation,
	is generated with constraints related to the river network, watershed
	boundary, elevation contours, vegetation, geology, etc. The underlying
	geometry and parameter fields are then projected onto the irregular
	network. The kernel-based formulation simplifies the process of adding
	or eliminating states, constitutive laws, or closure relations. The
	strategy is demonstrated for the Shale Hills experimental watershed
	in central Pennsylvania, and several phenomena are observed: (1)
	The enslaving principle is shown to be a useful approximation for
	soil moisture–water table dynamics for shallow soils in upland watersheds;
	(2) the coupling shows how antecedent moisture (i.e., initial conditions)
	can amplify peak flows; (3) the coupled equations predict the onset
	or threshold for upland ephemeral channel flow; and (4) the model
	shows how microtopographic information controls surface saturation
	and connectivity of overland flow paths for the Shale Hills site.
	The open-source code developed in this research is referred to as
	the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM).},

	This approach allows Tarsier model developers to craft object oriented
	solutions to large modelling problems. ICMS is a software system
	that supports the development of models in a custom modelling language
	that allows modellers with little programming experience to develop,
	integrate and visualise catchment models. Both frameworks provide
	sophisticated tools for model linking, data management, and data
	analysis and visualisation. By focusing on different user groups,
	Tarsier and ICMS have evolved into quite different environments,

	of the updating procedures currently used in real-time flood fo~ecastingm
	odelling. On the basis of results from the WMO project 'Simulated
	Real-Time Intercomparion of Hydrological Models', comprising more
	than 10 commonly used hydrological models and a variety of different
	updating procedures, an analysis of the relative importance of updating
	procedures and hydrological simulation models is provided. In particular,
	an intercomparison is made beteween two models (NAMSI IIMIKEI 1 and
	NAMKAL) consisting of the same hydrological model (NAM conceptual
	rainfall-runoff) but containing different routing modules (linear
	reservoirs versus hydraulic routing) and different updating procedures
	(error prediction versus state variable updating based on an extended
	Kalman filter). A main conclusion is that updating procedures significantly
	improve the performances of hydrological models for short-range forecasting.
	Furthermore, there are no clear conclusions regarding which type
	of updating procedure performs the better. However. intercomparison
	of the NAMS 11 and NAMKAL models indicates that the extended Kalman
	filter is marginally better than an error prediction model in cases
	where the basic hydrological model simulation is good. Finally, it
	is concluded that the basic simulation is very essential for accurate
	forecasts, and that the better the basic simulations are the better
	the updating routines in general function. This puts emphasis on
	the importance of thoroughly calibrating and validating the hydrological
	simulation models before applying then1 together with updating routines
	in operational real-time forecasting.},

	conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling is a major scientific and engineering
	challenge. This paper focuses on the total predictive uncertainty
	and its decomposition into input and structural components under
	different inference scenarios. Several Bayesian inference schemes
	are investigated, differing in the treatment of rainfall and structural
	uncertainties, and in the precision of the priors describing rainfall
	uncertainty. Compared with traditional lumped additive error approaches,
	the quantification of the total predictive uncertainty in the runoff
	is improved when rainfall and/or structural errors are characterized
	explicitly. However, the decomposition of the total uncertainty into
	individual sources is more challenging. In particular, poor identifiability
	may arise when the inference scheme represents rainfall and structural
	errors using separate probabilistic models. The inference becomes
	ill-posed unless sufficiently precise prior knowledge of data uncertainty
	is supplied; this ill-posedness can often be detected from the behavior
	of the Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Moreover, the priors on the
	data quality must also be sufficiently accurate if the inference
	is to be reliable and support meaningful uncertainty decomposition.
	Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of inferring inaccurate
	hydrologic models using rainfall-runoff data with large unknown errors.
	Bayesian total error analysis can overcome these problems using independent
	prior information. The need for deriving independent descriptions
	of the uncertainties in the input and output data is clearly demonstrated.},

	land-usage and surface cover and more than 65 m of topographic relief,
	the watershed is underlain by a complex interconnected sequence of
	sand and gravel aquifers that are separated by discontinuous clayey
	aquitards. A steady-state condition was achieved in the model by
	calibrating the subsurface flow field to 16 observation wells where
	long-term hydraulic head data were available, while simultaneously
	establishing a level of baseflow discharge on the surface regime
	approximating the level observed at the beginning of the transient
	simulation period. The model is then subjected to several hundred
	hours of rainfall data and the resulting discharge hydrographs are
	compared with the measured hydrographs. The calculated subsurface
	hydraulic head distribution and surficial rainfall-runoff responses,
	respectively, were shown to agree moderately well with those observed
	in the system during this period. The impact of an upland surficial
	contaminant source discharging along a reach of a small stream within
	the subcatchment was also examined. Results showed that short-duration,
	high-intensity concentration peaks were not captured if annual or
	monthly average rainfall was used as input. The hydraulic head and
	concentration variations due to short-duration rainfall variations
	showed a muted response with increasing depth below the streambed
	due to the natural smoothing in the hydraulic response and to dispersion
	and diffusion of the solute, respectively. Discrete daily precipitation
	events were also found to cause rapid changes in the calculated water
	and solute exchange fluxes. The variability and sensitivity of these
	near-stream processes to the temporal resolution of rainfall input,
	specifically the concentration and solute exchange flux responses,
	may be significant in the prediction of health risks to aquatic habitats.
	Overall, it is concluded that the model is capable of reproducing
	surface and subsurface hydrodynamic processes at the subcatchment
	scale although the results could be better through improved parameterization
	of the subcatchment and the manner in which the model simulates evapotranspiration
	processes.},

  abstract = {An energy balance snowmelt model was developed for the prediction
	of rapid snowmelt rates potentially responsible for soil erosion
	and surface water inputs. The model uses a lumped representation
	of the snowpack with two primary state variables, namely, water equivalence
	and energy content relative to a reference state of water in the
	ice phase at 0 oC. This energy content is used to determine snowpack
	average temperature or liquid fraction. Snow surface age is retained
	as a third state variable, used for the calculation of albedo. The
	model is driven by inputs of air temperature, precipitation, wind
	speed, humidity and radiation at time steps sufficient to resolve
	the diurnal cycle (hourly or six hourly). The model uses physically-based
	calculations of radiative, sensible, latent and advective heat exchanges.
	An equilibrium parameterization of snow surface temperature accounts
	for differences between snow surface temperature and average snowpack
	temperature without having to introduce additional state variables.
	Melt outflow is a function of the liquid fraction, using Darcy's
	law. This allows the model to account for continued outflow even
	when the energy balance is negative. Because of its parsimony (only
	three state variables) this model is suitable for application in
	a distributed fashion on a grid over a watershed. This report gives
	a detailed description of the model, together with results of tests
	against data collected at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, California;

	uncertainty assessment; Bayesian analysis; predictive uncertainty
	[1] The lack of a robust framework for quantifying the parametric
	and predictive uncertainty of conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) models
	remains a key challenge in hydrology. The Bayesian total error analysis
	(BATEA) methodology provides a comprehensive framework to hypothesize,
	infer, and evaluate probability models describing input, output,
	and model structural error. This paper assesses the ability of BATEA
	and standard calibration approaches (standard least squares (SLS)
	and weighted least squares (WLS)) to address two key requirements
	of uncertainty assessment: (1) reliable quantification of predictive
	uncertainty and (2) reliable estimation of parameter uncertainty.
	The case study presents a challenging calibration of the lumped GR4J
	model to a catchment with ephemeral responses and large rainfall
	gradients. Postcalibration diagnostics, including checks of predictive
	distributions using quantile-quantile analysis, suggest that while
	still far from perfect, BATEA satisfied its assumed probability models
	better than SLS and WLS. In addition, WLS/SLS parameter estimates
	were highly dependent on the selected rain gauge and calibration
	period. This will obscure potential relationships between CRR parameters
	and catchment attributes and prevent the development of meaningful
	regional relationships. Conversely, BATEA provided consistent, albeit
	more uncertain, parameter estimates and thus overcomes one of the
	obstacles to parameter regionalization. However, significant departures
	from the calibration assumptions remained even in BATEA, e.g., systematic
	overestimation of predictive uncertainty, especially in validation.
	This is likely due to the inferred rainfall errors compensating for
	simplified treatment of model structural error.},

	Flooding results from the combination of heavy precipitation and
	the distributed hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the basin.
	Accuracy and spatial scaling of radar estimated rainfall, and its
	impact at relevant hydrologic scales is an important determinant
	of hydrologic prediction accuracy and flood forecasting. Results
	of simulations using archival radar events are used to demonstrate
	the sources of uncertainty affecting site-specific flood forecasts
	within the distributed hydrologic model, Vflo. Radar data used in
	this analysis are derived from both S-band (NEXRAD/88D) and the Collaborative
	Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), polarimetric X-band radars.
	X-band radars have the capability to provide higher spatial and temporal
	resolution than the conventional radars operating at S-band. However,
	compared to S-band, X-band radars have shorter wavelengths and suffer
	from attenuation, or even total extinction of the radar signal at
	short ranges from the radar. Degradation of precipitation mapping
	is a serious concern, especially in heavy precipitation over distances
	associated with watersheds prone to flooding. Compared to rain gauge
	accumulations, X-band radar polarimetric rainfall estimates were
	significantly degraded beyond about 15 km from the radars. With rainfall
	input derived from X-band radars, uncertainty in runoff volume scales
	with watershed area as a smooth monotonically decreasing function
	as area increases due to averaging of random errors in the input.
	Relative to estimates derived from S-band radar, unreliable hydrograph
	response was produced using X-band polarimetric rainfall estimates
	as input to a physics-based distributed hydrologic model, especially
	for watershed areas less than about 20 km2. },

	a correction scheme that reduced the long-term precipitation bias

	simulation produced the most accurate peak flow forecasts, although
	it was susceptible to inadequate input data and the overdependence
	on the few available observations. The control simulation performed
	remarkably well, although several poor synoptic (MM5) forecasts,
	in addition to a model wet bias, produced a significant overprediction
	of peak flows over one watershed. The bias correction scheme did
	not prove worthwhile for peak flow forecasting, but may be useful
	for longer-term modeling studies where the emphasis is on long-term

	Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES), a component-based
	\{IEM\} system, from the standpoint of software design requirements
	which define system functionalities. Design requirements were identified
	in a series of workshops, attended by \{IEM\} practitioners, and
	reported in the development of a number of \{IEM\} software systems.
	The requirements cover issues associated with standards, component
	connectivity, linkage protocols, system architecture and functionality,
	and web-based access, all of which facilitate the creation of plug
	&amp; play components from stand-alone models through a series of
	software support tools and standards. },

  abstract = {This research demonstrates an application of artificial neural networks
	(ANN) for watershed-runoff and stream-flow forecasts. A watershed
	runoff prediction model was developed to predict stormwater runoff
	at a gauged location near the watershed outlet. Another stream flow
	forecasting model was formulated to forecast river flows at downstream
	locations along the same channel. Input data for both models include
	the current and preceding records of rainfall and stream flow gathered
	at the watershed outlet and downstream locations. Computational algorithms
	for both models were based on a commercially available software.
	A case study was conducted on a small urban watershed in Greensboro,
	North Carolina. These two ANN-hydrologic forecasting models were
	successfully applied to provide near-real-time- and near-term-flow
	predictions with lead times starting from the present time and advancing
	to a few hours later on 15-min increments. An important aspect of
	this research has been the development of methodology for input data
	organization, model performance evaluation, and ANN processing techniques.
	Encouraging results obtained indicate that ANN-hydrologic forecasting
	models can be considered an alternate and practical tool for stream-flow
	forecast, which is particularly useful for assisting small urban
	watersheds to issue timely and early flood warnings.},
